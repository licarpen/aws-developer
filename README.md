## IAM - Identity Access Management

* consists of Users, Groups, Roles
* Policies are written in JSON
* Big enterprises can integrate their own repo of users   
  * Identity Federation uses SAML standard (active directory)

## EC2

### Services Summary

* Renting virtual machines (EC2)
* Storing data on virtual drives (EBS)
* Distributing load across machines (ELB)
* Scaling services using auto-scaling group (ASG)

### Launching an EC2 instance running linux

* choose an AMI (software/operating system to be launched on server)
  * use Amazon Linux 2
* choose type of machine (memory and vCPUs)
  * t2.micro is free-tier
* storage is needed to store the operating system
* tags: key 'Name' is displayed in UI
* right-click on instance state in instance dashboard to start, stop, reboot, or terminate

### SSH

* SSH: mac, linux, windows >=10
  * copy Pv4 Public IP (example used below: 54.80.251.93)
  * check inbound rules for port and source
  * save key file (.pem)
  * change permissions for .pem
  ```chmod 0400 <your_key_file.pem>```
  ```ssh -i <your_key_file.pem> ec2-user@54.80.251.93```
  * Optional: check user with ```whoami```
  * exit with ```exit``` or ^C

* putty (alternative to SSH): windows  
* EC2 Instance Connect: all

#### Troubleshooting
* connection timeout is a security group issue
  * ensure inbound port is 22 and source is 0.0.0.00 and assigned to instance
* If firewall still prevents SSH, use EC2 Instance Connect
* ssh command not found: use Putty
* connection refused: instance is reachable but no SSH utility is running on it.  Restart and ensure Amazon Linux 2
* permission denied: wrong security key or wrong user (use ec2-user)
* working yesterday, but not today? Check Pv4 Public IP.  It changes when you restart instance.
